# Encypted-Chat
The purpose of this project was to give Java users who can run Java and JavaFX in an IDE a way to chat in a way that they are certain is secure. Unlike with other providers, like Whatsapp for example, you do not have to blindly trust that your messages will not be decrypted for their own purposes, or that they don't have some sort of backdoor access. We cannot know this because when we use those chat applications, we dont actually know what encryption code is run. The cool thing about this chat application is that the encryption is done using open source packages. This way no backdoor access can be added because the community, or you, would notice. Users can also change the code to alter the way their message is encoded so that only the two people chatting know its secret. So, if you want to be absolutely sure that not even your internet provider is able to see your messages, please check this out, and buy me a coffee at https://www.buymeacoffee.com/CassandraSehic. Thank you!
